# AutoCorrect-AHK-2.0

This is a combination of the 2007 [AutoHotkey AutoCorrect script](http://www.autohotkey.com/download/AutoCorrect.ahk) as well as [endolith's](https://gist.github.com/endolith/876629) script (as of 2020-11-05) with my customisations and additions.

My version contains a massive amount of new content from : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lists_of_common_misspellings 
(additions since the original 2007 script was made)
the Main list has increased from **5880** corrections up to **8140+**. 

**NOTE:** My script has been extensively edited **specifically for British English, NOT American English.** (e.g. customise / customize )

~~Future releases can include separated sections for British and American English variations~~

Have added **British to American, American to British sections within the script.** 
Still needs a lot of work to remove the duplicates in the main list allowing to easily uncomment and comment entire sections you prefer.
