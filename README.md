# AutoCorrect-AHK

This is a combination of the 2007 [AutoHotkey AutoCorrect script](http://www.autohotkey.com/download/AutoCorrect.ahk) as well as [endolith's](https://gist.github.com/endolith/876629) script (as of 2020-11-05) with my customisations and additions.

My version contains a massive amount of new content from : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lists_of_common_misspellings (additions since the original 2007 script was made)
the Main list has increased from 5880 corrections up to 8139 and counting. 

NOTE: My list has been extensively edited specifically for British English, NOT American English. (e.g. customise / customize )
Future releases (should I start getting help from others, can include separated sections for British and American English variations
