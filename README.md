# AutoCorrect-AHK

This is a combination of the 2007 [AutoHotkey AutoCorrect script](http://www.autohotkey.com/download/AutoCorrect.ahk) as well as endolith [https://gist.github.com/endolith/876629] with my customizations and additions.

My version contains a massive amount of new content from : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lists_of_common_misspellings (additions since the original 2007 script was made)
